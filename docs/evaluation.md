# Evaluation

On the evaluation day, you will need to submit:
1. Your `agent.py` file with your implementation
2. Any additional files you created to organize your code
3. An updated `requirements.txt` if you installed additional packages

Make sure to enter all the scipers of your team members in the SCIPERS constant at the top of the `agent.py` file so we can identify your team. DO NOT forget to fill it, otherwise your submission will not be graded.

We encourage you to use additional files to properly structure your code if needed. Just ensure that your main logic is implemented in the `agent.py` file and that any additional files are properly imported.

If you installed additional packages, you can generate an updated requirements.txt file by running:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
